At the end of today, I was a few calories short of filling up my rings, and my dog didn't feel like going out, so I went 
for a walk by myself, at night, listening to good music, as I used to do when I was a teenager.

Now, Billy Idol's [Cyberpunk](https://music.apple.com/fr/album/cyberpunk/1442990930?l=en-GB) (1993) is probably the best 
record I know of. It is just incredible. The Paris suburbia I grew up in is not exactly The Sprawl, and yet, listening 
to this record while striding empty rurban streets used to put me in a perfect Gibsonian mood.

Unfortunately, it didn't work as well tonight. It could be because my bourgeois neighbourhood is impervious to
Blade-Runnerization, no matter how good your soundtrack is; or maybe, after a few decades, the weight of the years 
anchors your mind too deep for your imagination to carry it away that easily. Or maybe I was just distracted by my 
uncomfortable socks.
