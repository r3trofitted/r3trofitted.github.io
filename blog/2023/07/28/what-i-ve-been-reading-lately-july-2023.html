    <h3 id="inside-the-skunkworks-machine-chris-dale-2022">Inside the Skunkworks machine (Chris Dale, 2022)</h3>

<p>]Skunkworks](https://music.apple.com/fr/album/skunkworks-deluxe-edition/1146014243) is one of my favorite records, and 
has been for almost 30 years now. A textured rock album, it&rsquo;s neither heavy metal (as fans of Bruce Dickinson would have 
hoped) nor grunge (as fans of Jack Endino would have guessed). It&rsquo;s simply great, I love it, and it is a shame that what 
was supposed to be a lasting band turned out to be a short-lived project, quickly shelved so that Dickinson could go 
back to heavy metal (and subsequently Iron Maiden).</p>

<p>Because they were so good, I kept track of the musicians behind Skunkworks for a while, especially Chris Dale, the 
bass player whose cool-looking instrument got me to cover my own bass with stickers. But I somehow missed a lot of 
things, including the self-publication of this book, by Dale, which covers everything about Skunkworks, the band, from 
the first auditions to the eventual disbanding.</p>

<p>In spite of its awful layout, Inside the Skunkworks machine is a great and riveting book – I couldn&rsquo;t put it down and 
read it almost in one go, stoppig only for a few hours of sleep. It is much more captivating than Dickinson&rsquo;s own 
autobiography, which turns to a slog of aeronautical anecdotes midway. Interestingly, Dickinson himself is 
rather absent from this book; not because he didn&rsquo;t contribute (that&rsquo;s only fair, it&rsquo;s Dale&rsquo;s book after all), but because 
he comes across as detached from the band&rsquo;s life. Not taking part in the frequent jams between the 3 musicians, arriving 
late to the sound checks and leaving early after the shows – often to go fly planes… And yet, he was the one repeating 
than Skunkworks was a real band (including when I saw them in 1996 at the Elysée Montmartre), while neither the 
management nor Dale seemed to really believe it…</p>

<p>In any case, Inside the Skunkworks machine is an exhaustive documentary on a great (albeit short-lived) musical project, 
and more importantly on a slice of the British rock scene of the mid-nineties and a bunch of passionate musicians who 
all, somehow, crossed the path of the ever-friendly Chris Dale.</p>

<h3 id="the-last-of-us-que-reste-t-il-de-lhumanité-nicolas-deneschau-2021">The Last of Us: que reste-t-il de l&rsquo;humanité (Nicolas Deneschau, 2021)</h3>

<p>My brother offered me this essay (in French) on the eponymous video games last Christmas; it tooks me 6 months to read it 
for 3 reasons: my backlog of books is shamefuly long, this one seemed a bit dry, and more importantly, I hadn&rsquo;t recovered 
from the emotional Vietnam that <em>The Last of Us part II</em> dragged me through.</p>

<p>Well, it turns out that this book was not as emotionnaly taxing as I feared, if still a bit dry. Furthermore, I don&rsquo;t 
really know what its point nor audience are.</p>

<p>Like the games alternate game and narrative sequences to unfold their stories, the book interlaces the retelling of said 
stories with either behind-the-scenes anecdotes or superficial gameplay analysis. This makes for an entertaining read, 
once you get used to its academic (and sometimes clumsly) voice, but not a very instructive one. Readers who have played 
the games probably don&rsquo;t need their recap, while total newcomers could benefit from a more immersive narration.</p>

<p>In the end, this book barely more than a love letter from a fan who has studied the game and all the making-of 
documentaries. I may bring back some memories, and offer some trivia, but not much else.</p>
