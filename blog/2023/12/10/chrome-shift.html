    <p>I am now four sessions deep into my <a href="https://rtalsoriangames.com/cyberpunk/#:~:text=Cyberpunk%20Red">Cyberpunk RED</a> 
campaign, codenamed <em>Chrome Shift</em>, and it seems like the group has found its rhythm, which is great. As we&rsquo;re 
reaching the end of the first scenario, here is a summary of the story so far, and my GM commentary track.</p>

<h3 id="saving-customers-with-extreme-prejudice">Saving customers with extreme prejudice</h3>

<p>The dystopian future of Cyberpunk RED is a dangerous place. In Night City, in 2045, violence is everywhere, from 
the combat zones to the executive enclaves, from the crater left by the nuke that blew up the corporate center to 
the rooftops of the skyscrapers erected during the reconstruction. Therefore, those who can afford it subscribe to 
privatized emergency services: teams of medics and paramilitary agents, half paramedics and half SWAT teams, who 
will rush to their wounded customers in their flying ambulance and carry them to a hospital, dealing with opposing 
resistance without restraint nor discrimination.</p>

<p>The best in this field are <strong>Trauma Team</strong> – they have the means, the gear, the reputation, the glamour of 
modern paladins, and they charge accordingly. The protagonists of <em>Chrome Shift</em> do <strong>not</strong> work for Trauma Team. 
Instead, they are contractors for <strong>REO MeatWagon</strong>, the under-staffed, unscrupulous, and a bit shady rival of 
Trauma Team.</p>

<p>The story started when the party, after an bad day, took on a last and unexpected intervention: MeatWagon&rsquo;s 
dispatch AI had intercepted an emergency call to Trauma Team, and there was a window of opportunity to steal 
this customer from them. After a brief firefight in an abandoned metro station<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> to get rid of two gangs 
exchanging fire, the <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Brainiacs">Brainiacs</a> and the 
<a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Inquisitors">Inquisitors</a>, the party successfully extracted the unfortunate 
customer caught in the crossfire, as well as his husband, and then evaded a very pissed off Trauma Team squad. 
Even more importantly, the party&rsquo;s solo<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> managed to get hold of an unknown device left on the scene – some 
kind of unmarked black box.</p>

<p>Once back to the MeatWagon HQ and medical center, the party was welcomed by their manager, <strong>Inglès</strong>, something as 
infrequent as him not slotting in his Cary Grant personality chip. The party then disbanded, only to be contacted 
by menacing members of the Brainiacs; the gang demanded the return of the device, which they claimed to have 
fairly bought from their still unidentified customer.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the party soon discovered that Inglès had stolen the device from the locker where it had been left, 
and then precipitously vanished. Leveraging the resources at their disposal at MeatWagon HQ, the party eventually 
localized their manager on the territory of a local posergang<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, the <strong>Tomb Raiders</strong>. Clever negociations 
granted them access an altered Inglès, detained in a state of primitive rage and seemingly unable to recoginize 
anyone. Unfortunately, it was quickly obvious that the Tomb Raiders had taken possession of the device, and 
would not let it go for free.</p>

<p>The party then moved their attention to the presumed seller of the device. His identity was soon revealed: nicknamed 
<strong><a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/3-Piece">3-Piece</a></strong>, this fixer had a certain renown, and a specialty in 
tech-related ventures. Tactfully approached, 3-Piece proved to be friendly and accomodating, and warned the party 
that being in possession of the device could attract dangerous attention, and especially that of a rival named 
<strong>Armalite</strong>, from whom 3-piece initially acquired it.</p>

<p>Intrigued but steadfast, the party worked on broking a meeting between the Tomb Raiders and one of their most 
dangerous rivals, the <strong><a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Slaughterhouse">Slaughterhouse</a></strong>. The deal granted 
them the ownership of the mysterious device, but as the party was leaving the abandonned skyscraper where it took 
place, shrieks and gunshots made clear that something had gone sideways in the negociations…</p>

<h3 id="gms-notes">GM&rsquo;s notes</h3>

<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m pretty happy with this introductory scenario so far. Except for a Kult one-shot a couple of months 
ago and two sessions of old-school Rolemaster dungeon dwelling the year before, I hadn&rsquo;t GM&rsquo;ed anything in 
years. And our group is still not very well-organized for remote play – we haven&rsquo;t found a VTT we all like, 
there is always a problem with someone&rsquo;s audio setup, and most players aren&rsquo;t confortable showing their faces 
on camera.</p>

<p>For this reason, and because Cyberpunk RED is a new game for everyone, and even a whole new genre for one of the 
players, I went for a very simple scenario. It is a McGuffin hunt, but it offers several hooks for mysteries, 
politics and intrigue (something the players said they were looking for). It also leans in on the backgrounds of 
the characters, at least some of them. (The lifepath system of Cyberpunk RED is really great for building rich 
backgrounds, and our session 0 was very inspiring.)</p>

<p>I used to play with this guys<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> 20 years ago, but then life dragged me away from the gaming table. However, 
most of them managed to keeping playing, and it showed! I was positively surprised by their quick-thinking during 
the <em>development</em> beats, and their tactical sense during the <em>cliffhanger</em> beats, to reuse the game&rsquo;s terminology. 
Still, I had a hard time keeping everyone invested, even though the feedback I&rsquo;ve gathered is positive 
(<a href="https://cybernationuncensored.com">Rob Mulligan</a>&rsquo;s GM report card in 
<a href="https://rtalsoriangames.com/downloadable-content#:~:text=Listen%20%21%20to%20Rob">his DLC</a> is pretty great for 
that). I hope that with a better setup, and more familiarity with the rules and the setting, everyone will get 
into the flow of the game.</p>

<h3 id="house-rules-and-changes-to-the-setting">House rules and changes to the setting</h3>

<p>Like many GMs, I like to create my own campaign settings and imaginary worlds. Yet, I also like to stick to 
whatever a game offers: it is usually what the rules are tailored for, professional game designers are better 
at this than me, and it is easier for the players to be on the level with me if they have access to the same 
material. Cyberpunk RED is great, in that it lays down the groundwork, but leaves room for the GM to add their 
own spin on things. So <em>my</em> Cyberpunk RED is basically what you read in the core rulebook, plus stuff 
taken from Willian Gibson, George Alec Effinger or Walter Jon Williams. And I adjust some details as I see fit, 
like giving REO MeatWagon its own, modest-ish medical center on top of their ambulance service (making it easier 
to slot in the medtech character).</p>

<p>However, there is one thing I have issues with in the original setting, and that is the timeline. In order to 
maintain continuity with stuff written 30 years ago, and also with the video game, you need to somehow conceive 
a world that is very different from ours, where technology accelerated exponentially in the last decades of the 
20th century, but then somehow stalled from 2020 to 2077. It&rsquo;s a detail, but it irks me. So I&rsquo;ve blurred the 
timeline and keep the dates very ellusive. The campaign takes place in 2045. Some time ago, a tactical nuke 
blew up the center of Night City and this marked the end of the 4th corporate war. Was it in 2023? 2033? 2043? 
It doesn&rsquo;t matter. Let&rsquo;s move on.</p>

<p>Rules-wise, I&rsquo;ve always liked the simplicity of the Interlock system, and even more of its successor, 
<a href="https://rpggeek.com/rpgsystem/478/fuzion">Fuzion</a>. I was a bit disappointed to see that CP-RED had moved back 
to a revised Interlock, but it&rsquo;s still a solid, simple if a bit old-school system, and I see no reason to house 
rule anything. So far, the new stuff, like the critical injuries replacing the hits location, worked fine.</p>

<p>I did import the time table for skills from Fuzion: I find it easier to have a set list of possible durations 
for a given task, especially when “taking more time” is often the only way for the players to try again a 
failed attempt. But the most significant change I&rsquo;ve made so far relates to the Trauma Team (or MeatWagon) 
intervention time, and the consequences of dying.</p>

<p>In the rules as written, when called for help, Trauma Team arrives in less than 20 seconds. That is stretching 
the versimilitude a bit, but it makes sense from a game perspective, since the time window to save a dying 
character is rarely larger than that. To keep things a bit more realistic, while preventing constant character 
deaths, I have introduced the following changes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Trauma Team, when called, arrives in 1d6 <em>minutes</em>, not <em>rounds</em>.</li>
  <li>But, as in Cyberpunk 2020, <em>death can be reverted</em>. This requireds a successful <strong>Surgery</strong> roll, whose 
difficulty is <strong>13 + the number of minutes elapsed since the character&rsquo;s death</strong> (rounded up). I like the idea 
that, in 2045, even death can be cured by technology.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="tomorrow-people">Tomorrow people</h3>

<p>I have a stable(-ish) gaming group, a game with a rich setting and a lean system, experienced players with a 
taste for both narrative and tactical play, and strong characters to write scenarios around. Now all I need 
is better tooling for online play. I can&rsquo;t wait to see where the campaign goes!</p>
