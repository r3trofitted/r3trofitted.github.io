## [Hajime Sorayama](http://sorayama.jp/works/)

How can it be that I've been oblivious to this artist for so long, while his influence on some 
of my [favorite supplements](https://talsorianstore.com/collections/cyberpunk/products/chromebook-1-2) 
for [one of my favorite RPGs](https://rtalsoriangames.com/cyberpunk/) is so obvious? In any case, I'm 
catching up. So far I find these works equal parts sleak, outdated and uncomfortably objectifying. 
Which is probably the point.

## [We need to talk about interactors](https://mycodingtales.com/we-need-to-talk-about-interactors/)

A really great article, but be warned: it is very dense. And the best thing, to me, is not really that it's about interactors 
([the pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern)), but that the very acurate points raised could be applied 
to a lot of over-used and under-understood patterns, first amond them my nemesis, the _service objects_. This article 
is about the misuse of interactors, but also about the problems that come with any similar misuse: the bad incentives 
it gives, the accidental blurring of the lines between OO and other programming paradigms, the wrong precedents it 
sets in the minds of beginners. Very wise stuff.

## [Red Fang](https://redfang.net)

This band kept popping up in my recommandations but for some reason I didn't pay attention to them… Well, my mistake: 
they're great. A bit of [The Sword](https://theswordofficial.com) and a bit of [The Damned Things](https://thedamnedthings.com), 
including the absurdness of their [music videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWhqIoRufQ). Like a laid-back (but still ballsy) 
version of Mastodon, these guys are obviously [nerdy](https://twitter.com/RedFang/status/1559609949952647170?s=20) metal dads. 
How could I not relate?

## [What's the Next GOTO?](https://youtu.be/3aw7777DS58)

I loved this presentation – it's everything I like: a fascinating history of programming that leads to challenging thoughts, 
packaged in a passionate, accessible and funny delivery. Very highly recommended. I only wish that Cantrell had had the time 
to cover the NULL issue that's teased in the presentation…

## [wizards-castle](https://github.com/gbirchmeier/wizards-castle)

For some reason, I keep stumbling upon rewrites of old, text-based adventure games. I never played these games, having been 
raised on the [next generation](https://cpcrulez.fr/GamesTest/la_chose_de_grotemburg.htm) of such delights, on a 
[different hardware](https://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/2666/Amstrad-CPC-6128/), but I'm really curious about 
them, and really want to look at their modern re-implementation. I expect clever code and nostalgia-inducing gameplay.
