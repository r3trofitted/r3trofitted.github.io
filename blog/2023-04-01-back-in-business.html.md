In my early tweenties, back when I half-seriously planned on becoming a professional musician, I wrote a 
few songs. (The couple of 4-track demos and rehearsal recordings where they featured  are long gone, but they were nothing 
groundbreaking, and no big loss to the fate of analog storage, rest assured.) And the very first song that I wrote was 
called _Back In Business_. Its music was probably a rip-off of Iron Maiden; the lyrics were inspired by Tanith Lee's 
novel _Kill The Dead_.

Anyway, I feel like blogging again.
