## [It's 2023, here is why your web design sucks.](https://heather-buchel.com/blog/2023/10/why-your-web-design-sucks/)

Probably the best article I've stumbled upon in the past couple of weeks. Reading it go me so excited that I 
couldn't help but forwarding it around, especially to designers or managers I've worked with in the past. Heather 
Buchel explains exactly what I've been trying to say for years, but way better than I ever could, and with 
an extra dash of insights (especially regarding gender-based territoriality). And I love her tone.

## [Whitespace Characters to Copy and Paste](https://qwerty.dev/whitespace/)

Or, more importantly, whitespace characters to learn about. I'm a rather lenient person, but when it comes to 
typography, I gladly nitpick like the nerd I am (deep inside). I stumbled upon this great site when searching 
for a design solution to a [spacing issue]() in my latest pet project. You can bet that it's now in my bookmarks.

## [YAML Multiline](https://yaml-multiline.info)

Another reference I'm happy to bookmark, now that I'm back to 1998 and actually browser features like bookmarks 
again. (By the way, do you remember [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/u:r3trofitted/)?) Anyway, YAML is confusing 
and will occasionally trip you up, hopefully this will help.

## [Super Color Palette](https://supercolorpalette.com)

Another great tool, that I learned about through [Brandon James Greers](https://www.youtube.com/@BJGpixel) (who 
makes pictures out of tiny squares). I've been building up several new things recently, and UI design can be 
alien enough to stop me in my tracks, but this kind of tool helps a lot to push through.

## [Constructing subclasses of Data with positional arguments](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/19278)

My original notes for the link where: _What a thread. Talk about tone._ In hindsight, they suffice.
