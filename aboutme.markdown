# Hi, my name is Ronan!

Introducing one's self is not as easy at it sounds. As Alain De Botton [brilliantly explained](https://www.alaindebotton.com/status/), 
“What do you do?” is an innocuous question with high stakes. When I was 16, I wanted to be a writer. When I was 20, I 
wanted to be a musician. In the end, I’ve become a programmer, or maybe a 
[gardener of programmers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/r3trofitted/), and I’m incredibly happy with this.
