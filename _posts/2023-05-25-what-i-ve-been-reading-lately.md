## The Peripheral (William Gibson, 2014)

This book has been mocking me for year. As a life-long Gibson fan, I bought The Peripheral on the day 
of its release… and it has been sitting on my shelves for almost 10 years. I've been trying to read it 
every couple of years, only to give up around the third chapter. I guess that the usual Gibsonian crypticness, 
with its glossed-over neologisms and vague, uncanny-valley-generating everyday devices were too strong for my 
already deteriorating attention span. This time, spurred by curiosity for the TV adaptation, I pushed through, and I'm 
glad I did.

Overall, The Peripheral is a typical Gibson novel, for better or worse. I find Gibson really good at outlining atmospheres, 
precise and delightful silhouettes of characters ink-brushed fifteen minutes into our future. I love his ability to 
keep a delicate balance between thought-provoking anticipations and quiet pacing; it always makes me feel like Case 
waking on the empty and entirely virtual beach that Neuromancer has trapped him on. However, I'm more and more disappointed 
by Gibson's plots, which are often weak and frail. It's even more the case here, with an ending that seems tacked in at 
the last minute, and a bit dissonant.

Still, in spite of a steep start and a rushed ending, the novel was a pleasant journey. And I don't have to feel 
guilty every time is see the book in my library anymore.

## Un feu dans le ciel nordique (Baptiste Pilo, 2022)

A book titled _A Blaze in the Northern Sky – black metal in Norway (1991-1999)_ can only be someone's thesis, and this 
is exactly the case here. I bought it on a whim while browsing the _arts & music_ section of a bookstore; I'm not versed 
at all in black metal, but I was curious to know a bit better such a niche topic. Thankfully, for all its academical 
origins, this book is very easy to read, and does cover exhaustively its subject matter.

Interestingly, after reading it I feel like Norwegian black metal, for all its foul headlines and far-right sympathies, 
is mostly a negligible social and musical movement. The short-lived work of young adults with an inferiority complex 
(towards the Swedish death metal scene of the time, and possibly middle class in general) who decided that their limitations 
were actually sources of pride. It is no surprise that the only Norwegian black metal records I listen to (Immortal's 
_At the Heart of Winter_ and The Kovenant's _Animatronics_ and _SETI_) are not _really_ Norwegian black metal, having 
outgrown the genre with decent production or interesting arrangements – a trend that this book explains well.

In any case, _Un feu dans le ciel nordique_ is a pretty solid study; it touches upon the social, historical, and 
musical aspects of a niche genre, and doesn't shy away from its uncomfortable (or, I'd say, pathetic) parts. I learned 
quite a bit, including the fact that I don't really need to invest time in exploring this musical style any further.

## Kill the dead (Tanith Lee, 1980)

Tanith Lee is easily one of my favorite writers, in any genre (and she did write in a lot of different genres). I've read 
this one several times, but this time I read it in English.

It is as good a story as I remembered, with little action but no boring moment, and a great final twist. However, for the 
first time, I felt like Lee was maybe a bit _too_ clever for her own writing. Her irony, as well as her stylistic flourishes 
sometimes distracted me from the story. Parl Dro, the protagonist, definitely deserves to be witty and sharp, like the 
iconic hero that he is, but too much breaks the spell a bit. There's a reason why you don't hear Sergio Leone crack 
jokes behind the camera when the [man with no name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_with_No_Name) is on screen. Still, 
it's a great novel, very well written. Tanith Lee really knew how to build characters, scenes, and stories.

## Programming Ruby, 5th edition (Noel Rappin with Dave Thomas, 2023)

The infamous pickaxe is not exactly a thrilling read, but I never tire of going through new editions. This one is a good 
as the others, exhaustive but accessible. I like the polite reservations that Rappin expresses towards some of the new features 
of Ruby, such as type annotations, but that's probably because I share his doubts.

Still, next time I'll wait until the final version before reading the next edition – playing _spot the difference_ with 
each beta release felt a bit like a waste of time.
