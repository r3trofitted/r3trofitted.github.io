## [Web3's fake version of Web history](https://davekarpf.substack.com/p/web3s-fake-version-of-the-history)

I don't know if I subscribe to the author's reading of Chris Dixon's intents (and I don't know who this Dixon guy is anyway), 
but his history of the Web sure matches my recollections.

## [Trauma is Trauma: A Mental Health Talk with Kevin Smith](https://youtu.be/JBvc7Ny4iUk)

Smith is really an impressive storyteller. There are a few zeitgeisty new-age stuff in his speech that I didn't like, 
but overall, it's a powerful message shared in the most humble and articulate way. This guy is all heart and brains 
(and no fashion sense, obviously).

## [Boldly link where no one has linked before: Text Fragments](https://web.dev/text-fragments/)

I can't decide if I'm excited by the possiblities this proposal opens, or discouraged by its complexity and dependance 
on tools (i.e. potential browser lock-in) to be usable.

## [Meet Leland Chee, the _Star Wars_ Franchise Continuity Cop](https://www.wired.com/2008/08/ff-starwarscanon/)

My son finished _Star Wars Jedi: Survivor_ this week-end, and while diligently going through the endlessly rolling credits, 
we were astonished to see someone credited as the _Keeper of the Holocron_. It turns out that it's their actual job title,
including on their LinkedIn page. A cool nerd fairy tale. (Interestingly, the Wired article talks about continuity and 
refusing to retcon, but dates back from 2008, which puts things in perspective.)

## [WebKit Features in Safari 16.4](https://webkit.org/blog/13966/webkit-features-in-safari-16-4/)

Published a few weeks ago, but I only got to read this article recently. I don't really care for the WPA features, but I'm 
intrigued by CSS improvements like [margin-trim](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/margin-trim) or 
[font-size-adjust](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/font-size-adjust). And any improvement to the (already 
quite good) Web Inspector is always welcome in my book.
