I really, really liked [Midnight Mass](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10574558/). So much so that it got me to 
catch up with Mike Flanagan's "Haunting of" shows, which were, say, of uneven quality but still enjoyable. And 
it got me rather excited for The Fall of the House of Usher.

Now that I've watched this latest show, the more I think about it, the more I see issues in its pacing, tone, text and 
subtext, to the point that I honestly cannot be bothered to write a full post about it. Every pertinent opinion 
I could give can be found in the [Slate review](https://slate.com/culture/2023/10/the-fall-of-the-house-of-usher-netflix-mike-flanagan-edgar-allan-poe-adaptation.html) that 
I carefully refrained from reading before watching the show. Or, for a more personal touch, in the [three](https://ruby.social/@r3trofitted/111319120972931721)

during my quasi-binging:

> I like Mike Flanagan’s work, and I LOVED Midnight Mass, but I’m pretty disappointed by The Fall of the House of Usher 
> so far (meaning after 2 episodes).  
> ↳ Mark Hamill is pretty cool, though.

> Almost done with the Fall of the House of Usher. Watching the Flanacast again is nice, but this series really suffers 
> from Netflixis: it had good material for a movie but it got diluted to make too many episodes, and then padded with 
> over-styling. And the references to Poe’s works and current events are as artificial as the sets.

> Final thoughts on The Fall of the House of Usher: the poetry is really good (no shit, Sherlock) but the social 
> commentary is hollow (even if well-intended).
