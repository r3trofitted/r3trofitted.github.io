## Inside the Skunkworks machine (Chris Dale, 2022)

]Skunkworks](https://music.apple.com/fr/album/skunkworks-deluxe-edition/1146014243) is one of my favorite records, and 
has been for almost 30 years now. A textured rock album, it's neither heavy metal (as fans of Bruce Dickinson would have 
hoped) nor grunge (as fans of Jack Endino would have guessed). It's simply great, I love it, and it is a shame that what 
was supposed to be a lasting band turned out to be a short-lived project, quickly shelved so that Dickinson could go 
back to heavy metal (and subsequently Iron Maiden).

Because they were so good, I kept track of the musicians behind Skunkworks for a while, especially Chris Dale, the 
bass player whose cool-looking instrument got me to cover my own bass with stickers. But I somehow missed a lot of 
things, including the self-publication of this book, by Dale, which covers everything about Skunkworks, the band, from 
the first auditions to the eventual disbanding.

In spite of its awful layout, Inside the Skunkworks machine is a great and riveting book – I couldn't put it down and 
read it almost in one go, stoppig only for a few hours of sleep. It is much more captivating than Dickinson's own 
autobiography, which turns to a slog of aeronautical anecdotes midway. Interestingly, Dickinson himself is 
rather absent from this book; not because he didn't contribute (that's only fair, it's Dale's book after all), but because 
he comes across as detached from the band's life. Not taking part in the frequent jams between the 3 musicians, arriving 
late to the sound checks and leaving early after the shows – often to go fly planes… And yet, he was the one repeating 
than Skunkworks was a real band (including when I saw them in 1996 at the Elysée Montmartre), while neither the 
management nor Dale seemed to really believe it…

In any case, Inside the Skunkworks machine is an exhaustive documentary on a great (albeit short-lived) musical project, 
and more importantly on a slice of the British rock scene of the mid-nineties and a bunch of passionate musicians who 
all, somehow, crossed the path of the ever-friendly Chris Dale.

## The Last of Us: que reste-t-il de l'humanité (Nicolas Deneschau, 2021)

My brother offered me this essay (in French) on the eponymous video games last Christmas; it tooks me 6 months to read it 
for 3 reasons: my backlog of books is shamefuly long, this one seemed a bit dry, and more importantly, I hadn't recovered 
from the emotional Vietnam that _The Last of Us part II_ dragged me through.

Well, it turns out that this book was not as emotionnaly taxing as I feared, if still a bit dry. Furthermore, I don't 
really know what its point nor audience are.

Like the games alternate game and narrative sequences to unfold their stories, the book interlaces the retelling of said 
stories with either behind-the-scenes anecdotes or superficial gameplay analysis. This makes for an entertaining read, 
once you get used to its academic (and sometimes clumsly) voice, but not a very instructive one. Readers who have played 
the games probably don't need their recap, while total newcomers could benefit from a more immersive narration.

In the end, this book barely more than a love letter from a fan who has studied the game and all the making-of 
documentaries. I may bring back some memories, and offer some trivia, but not much else.
