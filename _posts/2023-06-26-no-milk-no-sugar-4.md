## [Attenborough Lore](https://www.youtube.com/@AttenboroughLore/about)

"A foray into the Warhammer 40,000 lore, as narrated by an AI of the venerable Sir David Attenborough." I've 
been binging on these videos recently – the richness and horror of the 40K lore pairs really well, in an ironic way, with 
Sir Attenborough's simulated elocution. The results are really impressive – finally a good use of deep fake tech!

## [Intel One Mono](https://github.com/intel/intel-one-mono)

I'm a sucker for fonts, especially so-called progamming fronts. This one looked really good… on the screenshots. I installed it 
and immediately went back to my dear [Monofur](https://www.fontspace.com/monofur-font-f39937).

## [WebXR](https://immersiveweb.dev)

I'm really excited by visionOS and the idea of “spatial computing”. I'm usually suspicious of attempts to use web tech to 
build desktop-like apps, but this may be an easy way in this new landscape. I'm willing go give it a try. (But I'm also downloading 
XCode and dusting off my Swift reference book as I'm typing this…)
