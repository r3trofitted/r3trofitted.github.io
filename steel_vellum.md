This ongoing series was initially meant to be a set of live-coding[^1] videos, but I've decided 
to turn the recordings into long-form articles instead. Hopefully they will keep the freshness 
and the honesty of live coding – in other words, they'll show the mistakes and back-and-forths – 
while sparing you the awkward pauses and unintelligible mumblings.

As for the topic, it is on building a Ruby from scratch, with a clear goal but no preconceived 
idea on the overall design. Instead, we'll resort to behavior-driven development and test-driven 
development. And certainly take detours for technical asides from time to time. Enjoy!
