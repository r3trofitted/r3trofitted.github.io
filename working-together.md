Hello!

Maybe we've met at a conference and had a pleasant chat. Or maybe you've read [my toots](https://ruby.social/@r3trofitted) 
and somehow found them a good indicator of professionalism. Or maybe you've stumbled upon my 
[LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/r3trofitted/). In any case, if you're here, you're 
probably interested in us working together.

I am **currently available** for a **CTO** (possibly as a co-founder) or staff engineer position. Labels can be 
misleading, but these fit the best what I'm good at: **building a team and a product** on solid grounds, and 
then **growing them healthily**.

**Tech-wise**, I am experienced in a broad range of topics, from infrastructure to compliance through security and 
development, with a strong emphasis on the later, especially in Ruby, Rails, and sane, modern HTML/CSS/JS.

**Product-wise**, though by no means would I consider myself a product manager (a position I find debatable), I 
have a long experience in working with users, customers and prospects, and have often found myself 
mentoring eventual product-managing people.

Finally, talking about mentoring and **people in general**, I also have a good track record in recruiting, managing and 
nurturing developers, as well as building efficient, cross-functional teams.

When it comes to **C-level topics**, I'm a firm believer in bootstrapped companies, small but efficient teams, 
and being remote-first.

If all this intrigues you, or even better if you recognise yourself in these values and believe that my 
own set of peculiar skills would be a fitting complement to yours, please [get in touch](mailto:ronan@2-45.pm). 
I'd be happy to discuss your project and we could work together to make it successful.

Finally, if your needs are more specific and limited in time, I may be available for freelance work through 
my very hush-hush consulting company, **[Table 15.1](mailto:hello@tablefifteen.one)**.
