Gems are cool. They are shiny, colorful, and worth up to 5000 gold pieces each, according to the Game Master's Guide. 
In the Ruby world, though, gems are sometimes a bit mysterious ‚Äì they are magical pieces of software 
that do stuff for you once you've invoked them. To make things even more complicated, nowadays we 
don't even handle gems directly ‚Äì most of the time, we let another tool, [Bundler](https://bundler.io), 
do it for us. It's a shame, because understanding Ruby gems is also worth a lot. So, before we go on our journey, 
let's take a detour to see how gems work and how to build one ourselves.

### How gems work
`RubyGems`, first released in 2004, is "just" a Ruby library. But it is such an important one that it has been bundled 
with Ruby since 2007 (and Ruby 1.9) When you install Ruby on a computer, RubyGems is installed, too; and when you run a 
run a Ruby script or a REPL, RubyGems is automatically required for you.

And when it is required, RubyGems "hijacks" the native `Kernel#require` method so that files are looked for in more places 
than normal ‚Äì including certain directories that RubyGems knows about, and where it can install specifically packaged 
Ruby libraries, called _gems_.

RubyGems also comes with an executable, `gem`, that can (among other things) fetch, unpack, and install gems in those 
directories. Gems installed by the `gem` command will be found by the hijacked `require` method, and _voil√†_: Ruby 
programmers can enjoy a very easy way to distribute and integrate libraries in their Ruby programs.

In order for RubyGems to be able to install it, a gem must follow certain specifications. They are rather light, and 
well documented [in the RubyGems guides](https://guides.rubygems.org/what-is-a-gem/). The minimal setup for a gem is:

*    A `lib/` directory, which will contain the gem's code ‚Äì at the very least, in a single file, which by convention is named after the gem.
*    A _gemspec_ file, also named after the gem (but with the `.gemspec` extension)

So, two files and one directory are enough for RubyGems to package everything into a single archive, or more importantly, 
to unpack said archive and install the library's code in the right place.

### Creating our gem
Several tools can generate a scaffolding for a new gem (such as [Bundler](bundler.io) or [Gemsmith](https://alchemists.io/projects/gemsmith)), 
but we'll do it from scratch, both as a learning exercice and to keep things minimal. And the first step in creating our 
gem is to name it.

Finding a good name is hard. The RubyGems guides provide [great advice on naming a gem](https://guides.rubygems.org/name-your-gem/), 
but they are more about conventions to follow (which we will!) than naming ideas. I like whimsical and colorful names, 
so something boring like `dnd_character_creator` is out of the question. Instead, let's use our imagination. What 
"builds character", in a fantasy world? Conan would probably say that it's action and combat - or more poetically, 
[steel](https://youtu.be/MKMG-FdCGtM). And we'll eventually write our character down on a character sheet ‚Äì a piece of 
paper, or in a fantasy world, vellum. So let's name our gem *Steel Vellum* ‚Äì or rather, `steel_vellum`. It sounds D&D-y 
enough for me.

Now that we have a name, we can create the files and folder that we need:

  ```console?prompt=ùÑ¢
  ùÑ¢ mkdir -p steel_vellum/lib
  ùÑ¢ touch steel_vellum/lib/steel_vellum.rb
  ùÑ¢ touch steel_vellum/steel_vellum.gemspec
  ```

According to [the documentation](https://guides.rubygems.org/specification-reference/), the gemspec file must contain 
the gem's specifications ‚Äì a lot of them can be defined, but only 5 are required: a name, a version number, the list 
of files that constitute the library, a short description and a list of authors. So let's add these to the 
`steel_vellum.gemspec` file.

  ```ruby?caption=steel_vellum.gemspec
  Gem::Specification.new do |s|
    s.name    = "steel_vellum"
    s.version = "0.1.0"
    s.files   = ["lib/steel_vellum.rb"]
    s.summary = "A D&D 5e character creation library"
    s.authors = ["Ronan Limon Duparcmeur"]
  end
  ```

As for the code of the libary itself, let's do the very bare minimum for now, and only provide a module. We could leave 
it empty, but let's also add a version number in the form of a constant ‚Äì just to have something to try out the gem with:

  ```ruby?caption=lib/steel_vellum.rb
  module SteelVellum
    VERSION = "0.1.0"
  end
  ```

It is enough? Will it work? Let's see if we can build the gem ‚Äì i.e. package it into a `.gem` file ‚Äì and install it.

  ```console?prompt=ùÑ¢
  ùÑ¢ cd steel_vellum
  ùÑ¢ gem build

    Name: steel_vellum

    File: steel_vellum-0.1.0.gem

  $ gem install steel_vellum-0.1.0.gem

  Successfully installed steel_vellum-0.1.0
  1 gem installed
  ```

RubyGems gave us a few warnings when it built the gem (and we'll address them later), but so far, everything seems fine. 
Let's check it out in a Ruby console:

  ```irb
  >> require "steel_vellum"
  => true
  >> SteelVellum::VERSION
  => "0.1.0"
  ```

It works! And we can see that the metadata we've added to our gem is indeed used:

  ```console?prompt=ùÑ¢
  ùÑ¢ gem info steel_vellum

  *** LOCAL GEMS ***

  steel_vellum (0.1.0)
      Author: Ronan Limon Duparcmeur
      Installed at: /Users/ronan/.gem/ruby/3.2.2

      A D&D 5e character creation library
  ```

(Note that the actual installation path will vary according to your Ruby installation.)

### Test setup
We now have the right foundations for our gem, and we could start adding code to the `lib/steel_vellum.rb` file. But we've 
decided to go tests-first as much as possible, so let's setup our project so that we can indeed write and run tests.

RSpec is a popular and extremely complete testing framework, but I prefer [Minitest](https://rubygems.org/gems/minitest) 
‚Äì it's lean and fast, and does everything you need but nothing more, which means that it's hard to shoot yourself in 
the foot (by abusing mocks or [over-DRYing](https://sandimetz.com/blog/2016/1/20/the-wrong-abstraction), for example), 
even if you can miss the syntactic sugar, sometimes. Plus, like RubyGems, Minitest comes bundled with Ruby.

However, even though Minitest doesn't need to be _installed_ (normally), it still needs to be declared as a _dependency_ of 
our gem. This is done through the gemspec file:

  ```ruby?caption=steel_vellum.gemspec
  Gem::Specification.new do |s|
    s.name    = "steel_vellum"
    s.version = "0.1.0"
    s.files   = ["lib/steel_vellum.rb"]
    s.summary = "A D&D 5e character creation library"
    s.authors = ["Ronan Limon Duparcmeur"]
    
    s.add_development_dependency "minitest"
  end
  ```

  ```console?prompt=ùÑ¢
  ùÑ¢ mkdir test
  ùÑ¢ touch test/steel_vellum_test.rb
  ```

The file itself only needs to require Minitest, but we'll add a placeholder test to ensure that everything works well:

  ```ruby?caption=test/steel_vellum_test.rb
  require "minitest/autorun"
  require "steel_vellum"
  
  class SteelVellumTest < Minitest::Test
    def test_it_works
      assert_equal "0.1.0", SteelVellum::VERSION
    end
  end
  ```

To run the test, when only need to run this file ‚Äì but we need to make sure that the `lib/` directory will be included 
in [Ruby's `$LOAD_PATH`](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Kernel.html#method-i-load).

  ```console?prompt=ùÑ¢
  ùÑ¢ ruby -Ilib test/steel_vellum_test.rb
  Run options: --seed 11645

  # Running:

  .

  Finished in 0.001717s, 582.4112 runs/s, 582.4112 assertions/s.

  1 runs, 1 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
  ```

Our test suite ‚Äì with its single test ‚Äì runs fine. But typing the name of every single test file to run will eventually 
become tedious, so ([as suggested in the documentation](http://docs.seattlerb.org/minitest/README_rdoc.html#label-Running+Your+Tests)), 
let's add a Rake task to run the whole suite for us. This is very easy, since Minitest provides one for us ‚Äì we only need 
to set it as the default Rake task for our project. And because we've stuck to the conventions when namimg files and 
directories, we need almost nothing: 

  ```ruby?caption=Rakefile
  require "minitest/test_task"
  
  Minitest::TestTask.create
  task :default => :test
  ```

And that's it! Now, executing `rake` without specifying a Rake task will run the whole test suite:

  ```console?prompt=ùÑ¢
  ùÑ¢ rake
  Run options: --seed 36531

  # Running:

  .

  Finished in 0.000540s, 1851.8521 runs/s, 1851.8521 assertions/s.

  1 runs, 1 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
  ```

### Final touches
And so, we have the basis for our Steel Vellum library, written with its tests and distributable as a gem. Let's wrap 
things up by smoothing the rough edges of this scaffold. We have a few warnings to fix, and our test runner could 
benefit from a more colorful output. More importantly, the gem's version number is currently written twice, which 
means extra maintenance ‚Äì or potential inconsitencies. Let's fix all that by removing the `VERSION` declaration from 
the main library file‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

  ```ruby?caption=lib/steel_vellum.rb
  module SteelVellum
  end
  ```

‚Ä¶ and placing it in its own file‚Ä¶

  ```ruby?caption=lib/steel_vellum/version.rb
  module SteelVellum
    VERSION = "0.1.0"
  end
  ```

‚Ä¶ which can then be required directly in the gemspec file:

  ```ruby?caption=steel_vellum.gemspec
  require_relative "lib/steel_vellum/version"
  
  Gem::Specification.new do |s|
    s.name     = "steel_vellum"
    s.version  = SteelVellum::VERSION
    s.summary  = "A D&D 5e character creation library"
    s.authors  = ["Ronan Limon Duparcmeur"]
    s.files    = Dir["lib/**/*.rb"]
    s.license  = "MIT"
    s.homepage = "https://github.com/r3trofitted/steel_vellum"
    
    s.add_development_dependency "minitest"
    s.add_development_dependency "minitest-reporters"
  end
  ```

Note that said gemspec file features new declarations, including a 
[globbing approach](https://ruby-doc.org/3.2.2/Dir.html#method-c-glob) to list files, and a development dependency on 
[minitest-reporters](https://github.com/minitest-reporters/minitest-reporters), a Minitest plugin that improves the 
tests output, even when sticking to the defaults, like so:

  ```ruby?caption=test/steel_vellum_test.rb
  require "minitest/autorun"
  require "minitest/reporters"
  Minitest::Reporters.use! Minitest::Reporters::DefaultReporter.new
  
  class SteelVellumTest < Minitest::Test
    # Let's add some!
  end
  ```

And _now_, we're [good to go](https://music.apple.com/fr/album/good-to-go/520098624)! Our detour is over and we're 
back on the road ‚Äì see you in part 3!
